# Krofiler.Web

Idea behind this profiler is pretty stright forward...
User uses global tool dotnet command `dotnet krofiler` which starts web server... User can then connect to this website from same or different machine(useful for live websites).

From that website(which is convinently crossplatform) user can make dumps, compare heapshots for leaks, find what is causing leaks with path-to-root and all other goodies..

Later another tool I would like to add is something similar to os_signpost view from XCode Instruments.
